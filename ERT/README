This directory contains a "baker's dozen" samples of Encoder Receiver Transmitter (ERT) Standard Consumption Message (SCM).
I chose this because these messages are very formatted so they are comparatively easy to learn URH on.

To capture these, I used rtl_433:
rtl_433 -R 149 -f 915M -S known

To use:
rtl_433 g001_915M_1000k.cu8
rtl_433 -A g001_915M_1000k.cu8
URH => Load File
